= Advantages of Cat =

Cat offers several advantages as a programming language: 
  * excellent performance - Cat can be easily optimized because it is statically type, and the syntax makes it easy to identify fusion algorithms
  * excellent parallelization - many primitive Cat operations can be easily implemented as parallel operations
  * improved safety - Cat's static type system provides easy verifiability of code 
  * compact representations - Cat is very compact because it introduces higher order functions
  * easy to learn - Cat has a very minimal set of core semantics and syntax
