= Quote =

The quote primitive function pops a value from the stack, and pushes a [Arity nullary] function that always returns that value onto the stack. 

The quote instruction is key to higher-order functional programming, and is used in the definition of basic [HigherOrder higher-order functions] such as [Currying curry].
