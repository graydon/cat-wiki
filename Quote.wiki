= Quote =

The quote primitive function pops a value from the stack, and pushes a [Arity nullary] function that always returns that value onto the stack. In other words the quote function creates a [Thunk thunk].

The quote instruction is key to higher-order functional programming, and is used in the definition of basic functions such as [Curry curry].
