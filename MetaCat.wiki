#summary About the MetaCat extension to Cat.

= MetaCat =

MetaCat is an extension to the core cat language of [Macros macro rewriting rules]. The primary role of MetaCat is for optimization. 

The MetaCat macros by themselves constitute a turing complete language. 

Another interesting observation about MetaCat is that it can be used to define much of the semantics of the core Cat language.

MetaCat is based on the paper [http://www.latrobe.edu.au/philosophy/phimvt/joy/j07rrs.html A Rewriting System for Joy] by Manfred von Thun.
