= Partial Evaluation =

Partial evaluation refers to the evaluation of subexpressions. Given an [Expression expression] such as: `[3 4 * +]`, a compiler can replace the sub-expression `3 4 *` with the value `12` that the expression is the same as: `[12 +]`. 

Only [Pure pure] expressions can pre-evaluated.

The [MetaCommand meta-command] for performing partial-evaluation is `#pe`.
