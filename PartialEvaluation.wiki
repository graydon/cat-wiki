= Partial Evaluation =

Partial evaluation refers to the evaluation of sub-expressions. Given the [Expression expression] `[3 4 * +] #p` a compiler will replace the sub-expression `3 4 *` with the value `12` so that the result is: `[12 +]`. 

Only [Purity pure] expressions can pre-evaluated.

The [MetaCommand meta-command] for performing partial-evaluation is `#p`.
