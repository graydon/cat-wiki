= Optimization =

One of the major design goals of Cat is as an [IntermediateLanguage intermediate language] for optimization. The Cat interpreter provides three tools for optimization: a [PartialEvaluation sub-expression evaluator], [InlineExpansion inline function expander], and a [MetaCat macro rewriting system].

The various optimization tools are controlled by the [MetaCommand meta-commands] `#p` for the [PartialEvaluation partial evaluator], `#i` for [InlineExpansion inline expansion], `#m` for [MetaCat macro application], and `#o` for optimization.

The `#o` optimization meta-command, rewrites [Quotation quotations] on the stack using a combination of different techniques.
