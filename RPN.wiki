= Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) =

Reverse polish notation, or postfix notation, is a mathematical notation where operators are written following the operands. For example instead of using the traditional syntax of writing `1 + 2`, using postfix notation we would write `1 2 +`. The common mathematical notation is known as infix notation. The third method of expressing mathematical expressions where operators precede the operands is known as prefix notation.
