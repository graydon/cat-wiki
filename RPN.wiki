= Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) =

Reverse polish notation, or postfix notation, is a mathematical notation where operators are written following the operands. For example instead of using the traditional syntax of writing `1 + 2', using postfix notation we would write `1 2 +'. Common mathematical notation is known as infix notation. The Scheme programming language is an example of a language that uses prefix notation.
