= Quotation =

A quotation is a function literal. Quotations have the effect of pushing an anonymous functions on to the stack. A quotation is created by surrounding an expression using the quotation operators `[` and `]`. Quotations can be evaluated using the `apply` primitive.

For example:

{{{
>> 3
stack: 3
>> [1 +]
stack: 3 [{1} +]
>> apply
stack: 4
}}}
