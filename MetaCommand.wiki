= Meta-Commands =

Meta-commands are commands intended for the interpreter and are explicitly not part of the Cat language. A meta-command typically starts with a hash character (`#`). Note that 
meta-commands are valid Cat identifiers, and could conflict with a user-definition. 

The meta-commands are:

  * `#t` - Infer types. 
    Usage: `[swap dup] #t`. See also: TypeInference.
  * `#m` - Apply loaded macros to a quotation on stack. 
    Usage: `[swap swap] #m`. See also: [Macros Macros].
  * `#pe` - Reduces a quotation on the stack by pre-evaluating sub-expressions. 
    Usage: `[2 3 + +] #pe`. See also: PartialEvaluation.
  * `#o` - Optimizes a quotation using a combination of techniques.
    Usage: `[[1 +] map [3 *] map] #o`. See also: [Optimization Optimization].
  * `#save` - saves a transcript of the session so far to the specified file name. 
    Usage: `"transcript.txt" #save`.
  * `#load` - opens and executes a file containing Cat code. 
    Usage: `"mylibrary.cat" #load`.
  * `#defs` - lists all loaded functions and their types. 
    Usage: `#defs`.
