= Type Inference =

Type inference is when a compiler can infer a type of a variable or function that isn't explicitly declared in the source code, by examining how it is declared. 

The Cat programming language supports type inference, but the current release of the interpreter does not yet [http://code.google.com/p/cat-language/issues/list support this functionality].
