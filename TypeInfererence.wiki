= Type Inference =

Type inference is when a compiler can deduces the type of a variable or function that isn't explicitly declared in the source code, by examining how it is declared and used. 

The Cat interpreter will explicitly infer the type of a quotation using either the 'type_of' primitive function or using the '#t' [MetaCommand meta-command]. The '#t' meta-command shows the step by step process of deriving a type. 

The current Cat implementation type inference algorithm, only does a signle constraint resolution pass.
