= Introduction =

Cat is a [Functional functional] [StackLanguages stack-based programming language]. 

All operations in Cat manipulate a single shared stack.

== Postfix Notation ==

If you type a number in Cat it is pushed onto the stack as so:

{{{
>> 2
stack: 2
>> 3
stack: 2 3
}}}

You call then write an operator such as: 

{{{
>> add
stack: 5
}}}

If you want to remove an item from the stack you can call `pop`:

{{{
>> pop 
stack: _empty_
}}}

You can also enter multiple numbers or instructions on the same line:

{{{
>> 1 2 3
stack: 1 2 3 
}}} 

You can remove all items from a stack by calling `clr`:

{{{
>> clr
stack: _empty_
}}}

== Stack Manipulation ==

The three basics instructions for manipulating the stack are:

  * `pop` - remove top item from stack
  * `dup` - duplicate top item on stack
  * `swap` - swap the top two items on the stack
