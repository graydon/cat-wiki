#summary A tutorial on the Cat language

= Introduction =

Cat is a [Functional functional] [StackLanguages stack-based programming language]. 

All operations in Cat manipulate a single shared stack.

== Postfix Notation ==

If you type a number in Cat it is pushed onto the stack as so:

{{{
>> 2
stack: 2
>> 3
stack: 2 3
}}}

You call then write an operator such as: 

{{{
>> +
stack: 5
}}}

If you want to remove an item from the stack you can call 'pop':

{{{
>> pop 
stack: _empty_
}}}

You can also enter multiple numbers or instructions on the same line:

{{{
>> 1 2 3
stack: 1 2 3 
}}} 

You can remove all items from a stack by calling 'clr':

{{{
>> clr
stack: _empty_
}}}

The three basics instructions for manipulating the stack are:

  * 'pop' - remove top item
  * 'dup' - duplicate top item
  * 'swap' swap top two items
