= Stack Based Languages =

Stack based languages (also known as stack-oriented languages) are programming languages with the characteristic that they pass arguments to, and return results from, functions using one or more shared stacks. 

Some well known examples of stack-based languages include Postscript and Forth, as well as several intermediate languages such as the .NET common intermediate language (CIL) and Java byte-code (JVML).

Stack-based languages usually use a [RPN postfix notation] also known as reverse polish notation.
